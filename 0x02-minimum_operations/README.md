# Minimum Operations

For this project, you will need to understand several key algorithmic and mathematical concepts to devise a solution that efficiently calculates the minimum number of operations to achieve a given number of characters using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations.

## Concepts Needed

### Dynamic Programming

Familiarity with dynamic programming can help in breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and building up the solution.
