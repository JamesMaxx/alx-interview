# Must Know Concepts for Project Completion

## Lists and List Comprehensions

- Creating, accessing, modifying, and iterating over lists.
- Using list comprehensions for concise and readable code, especially for Pascal’s Triangle.

## Functions

- Defining and calling functions.
- Passing parameters and returning values, especially returning a list of lists for Pascal’s Triangle.

## Loops

- Utilizing for and while loops to iterate through sequences.
- Understanding nested loops for generating each row and calculating values in Pascal’s Triangle.

## Conditional Statements

- Applying if, elif, and else conditions based on the position in Pascal’s Triangle.
- Recognizing patterns like the edges always being 1.

## Recursion (Optional)

- Understanding recursion for an alternative approach to generating Pascal’s Triangle.
- Identifying base cases and recursive cases for row generation.

## Arithmetic Operations

- Performing addition, crucial for calculating each element based on the two elements above it.

## Indexing and Slicing

- Accessing elements and slices of lists, essential for identifying and summing correct elements.

## Memory Management

- Being mindful of list storage and copying when creating new rows based on previous row values.

## Error and Exception Handling (Optional)

- Using try-except blocks as needed to handle potential errors like invalid input types.

## Efficiency and Optimization

- Evaluating time and space complexity for different approaches.
- Applying optimizations to enhance performance, especially for large Pascal’s Triangles.
