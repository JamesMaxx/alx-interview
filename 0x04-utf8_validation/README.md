# 0x04. UTF-8 Validation

This project is about validating whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

## Description

For the “0x04. UTF-8 Validation” project, you will need to apply your knowledge in bitwise operations, understanding of the UTF-8 encoding scheme, and Python programming skills to validate whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

## Concepts Needed

- Bitwise Operations in Python
- UTF-8 Encoding Scheme
- Data Representation
- List Manipulation in Python
- Boolean Logic

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All your files must be executable

## Tasks

## 0. UTF-8 Validation

   Write a method that determines if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.
   Prototype: def validUTF8(data)
   Return: True if data is a valid UTF-8 encoding, else return False
