# 0. Island Perimeter

## Description

You are given a map in form of a matrix where 1 represents land and 0 represents water. The island is fully enclosed by water, and there is exactly one island. The island is represented by a group of 1s.

Find the perimeter of the island.

## Concepts Needed

1. Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
2. Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).
3. Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.
4. Counting techniques.
5. Understanding how to break down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.
6. Python Programming.

## Python Programming

1. Nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
2. Conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.

## Solution

Please refer to the `island_perimeter.py` file for the solution.
