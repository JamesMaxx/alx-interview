# Making Change: Greedy Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Algorithmic Complexity, Problem-Solving Strategies, Python Programming

## Introduction

(0-20)
This repository contains a Python program that solves the coin change problem using greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, and problem-solving strategies. The program takes an integer `n` representing the total amount to be made up and a list of integers `coins` representing the available coins. The program will output the minimum number of coins needed to make up the total.

## Greedy Algorithms

(0-20)
Greedy algorithms are a powerful optimization technique that can solve several types of problems. They follow the principle of making the locally optimal choice at each step, with the hope of finding a global optimum. In the context of the coin change problem, a greedy algorithm can be used to select the coin that gives the largest value for the least number of coins.

### Understanding how greedy algorithms work

(0-20)
Greedy algorithms work by considering the problem in a step-by-step manner. At each step, the algorithm selects the option that seems to be the best choice at that moment. The algorithm repeats this process until a solution is found or the problem is solved.

In the coin change problem, a greedy algorithm can be used to repeatedly select the coin that gives the largest value for the least number of coins. The algorithm starts with the largest coin and selects as many of them as possible until the remaining amount is less than the value of the current coin. It then moves on to the next coin and repeats the process.

### Why greedy algorithms are suitable

(0-20)
Greedy algorithms are suitable for solving the coin change problem because they can find a locally optimal solution that is optimal in the sense that no other solution with the same number of coins can have a smaller total value. However, greedy algorithms may not always provide the optimal solution. There are scenarios where greedy algorithms may not work optimally, such as when the coins have a complex relationship with each other.

## Dynamic Programming

(0-20)
Dynamic programming is a method to solve optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems and solving each sub-problem only once. It is particularly useful for problems that have overlapping sub-problems and optimal substructure.

### Basic principles of dynamic programming

(0-20)
Dynamic programming involves identifying the overlapping sub-problems and solving them only once. It is a bottom-up approach where the solution to a sub-problem is used to construct the solution to a larger problem. The sub-problem solutions are stored in a table or a list, and the algorithm retrieves the solutions to sub-problems as needed.

### Overlapping sub-problems and optimal substructure

(0-20)
Dynamic programming works well when the problem exhibits overlapping sub-problems and optimal substructure. Overlapping sub-problems means that a sub-problem is solved more than once. Optimal substructure means that the solution to a problem can be constructed from the solutions of its sub-problems.

In the coin change problem, dynamic programming can be used to solve the problem by breaking it down into smaller sub-problems. Each sub-problem is the minimum number of coins needed to make up a certain amount. The solution to a sub-problem can be constructed by selecting the minimum number of coins from the available coins.

## Algorithmic Complexity

(0-20)
Algorithmic complexity refers to the amount of time and space required to solve a problem. It is important to analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms to meet runtime constraints and optimize the solution.

### Analyzing time and space complexity

(0-20)
The time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of time it takes to solve a problem as a function of the size of the input. It measures the efficiency of the algorithm. The space complexity of an algorithm is the amount of memory it uses to solve a problem. It measures the efficiency of the algorithm in terms of memory usage.

In the coin change problem, the time complexity of the greedy algorithm and the dynamic programming algorithm can be analyzed. The greedy algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the total amount to be made up. The dynamic programming algorithm has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the total amount to be made up and m is the number of available coins.

### Striving for lower complexity

(0-20)
To meet runtime constraints, it is important to strive for solutions with lower complexity. This can be achieved by optimizing the algorithm and reducing the number of operations needed to solve the problem. In the case of the coin change problem, dynamic programming can provide a solution with lower complexity by breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems and solving them only once.

## Problem-Solving Strategies

(0-20)
Problem-solving strategies refer to the techniques used to approach and solve problems. Breaking down a problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems is a common problem-solving strategy.

### Breaking down the problem

(0-20)
Breaking down a problem into smaller sub-problems helps to understand the problem better and to identify the optimal solution. In the case of the coin change problem, breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems involves identifying the minimum number of coins needed to make up different amounts.

### Iterative vs recursive approaches

(0-20)
Dynamic programming can be implemented using either iterative or recursive approaches. Iterative approaches involve using loops to solve the problem and store the solutions in a table or list. Recursive approaches involve defining a recursive function to solve the problem. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages.

## Python Programming

(0-20)
Python programming is a powerful language that can be used to implement algorithms and solve problems. Manipulating lists and using list comprehensions is a common technique in Python programming.

### Manipulating lists and using list comprehensions

(0-20)
Python provides a built-in data structure called a list that can be used to store and manipulate data. Lists can be manipulated using various methods and functions. List comprehensions are a concise way to create lists by applying a loop-like syntax. They are often used to generate lists based on conditions or transformations.

### Implementing functions with efficient looping and conditional statements

(0-20)
Functions are a fundamental building block in programming. Efficient looping and conditional statements are important to implement algorithms effectively. Python provides various looping and conditional statements that can be used to implement functions efficiently. These include loops like for and while loops, conditional statements like if and elif statements, and logical operators like and and or.
